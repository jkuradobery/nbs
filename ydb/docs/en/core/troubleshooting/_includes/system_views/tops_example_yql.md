Top queries by execution time for the last minute when queries were made

  ```sql
  PRAGMA AnsiInForEmptyOrNullableItemsCollections;
  $last = (
      SELECT
          MAX(IntervalEnd)
      FROM `.sys/top_queries_by_duration_one_minute`
  );
  SELECT
      IntervalEnd,
      Rank,
      QueryText,
      Duration
  FROM `.sys/top_queries_by_duration_one_minute`
  WHERE IntervalEnd IN $last
  ```

  Queries that read the most bytes, broken down by minute

  ```sql
  SELECT
      IntervalEnd,
      QueryText,
      ReadBytes,
      ReadRows,
      Partitions
  FROM `.sys/top_queries_by_read_bytes_one_minute`
  WHERE Rank = 1
  ```
