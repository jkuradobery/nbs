   * Improved the visualization of query explain plan graphics.
   * Problem storage groups have more visibility now.
   * Various improvements based on UX research.

* Query Processing:
   * Added Query Processor 2.0, a new subsystem to execute OLTP queries with significant improvements compared to the previous version.
   * Improved write performance by up to 60%, and by up to 10% for reads.
   * Added the ability to include a NOT NULL restriction for YDB primary keys when creating tables.
   * Added support for renaming a secondary index online without shutting the service down.
   * Improved the query explain view that now also includes fields for the physical operators.
